# Interactive Design and Technology (IDT)

Official Website: https://saskpolytech.ca/programs-and-courses/programs/Interactive-Design-and-Technology.aspx

> With technology literally reinventing the way we do things (think mobile, 3D printing, social media), now is a great time to turn your interest into a career. Saskatchewan Polytechnic offers a two-year Interactive Design and Technology (IDT) diploma program.

>The Interactive Design and Technology program is offered full-time at Saskatchewan Polytechnic Regina Campus and Saskatchewan Polytechnic Saskatoon Campus, with some courses available online through distance learning.

This organization is set up to be used with IDT students during their coursework so they can experience collaborative development in an environment similar to industry. There aren't many public repositories, but perhaps in the future some student work will be shared here!
